Today was an exciting day for Camp Rhino.  Bro. Mark made an offer on a 21 acre property known as Van Staden's.  The owner asked 1.75million Rand ($150,000 US Dollars).  Mark's offer was for 1.5 million Rand ($130,000 US Dollars).  Pray that the Lords will be done.  The owner has till Friday to either accept or reject the offer. Take a look at Mark's Facebook page to view the video of this property.  We will keep you posted
