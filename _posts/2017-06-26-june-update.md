We are ahead of schedule for our fund raising.  Our goal was to reach $50,000 before the end of June, but we were able to surpass that goal within the first week of June.

We are very excited about the progress and look forward to the last half of our furlough.  We await to see who else wants to team up with us to make Camp Rhino a reality.
