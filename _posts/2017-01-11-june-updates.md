We are ahead of schedule for our fund raising. &nbsp;Our goal was to reach $50,000 before the end of June, but we were able to surpass that goal within the first week of June. &nbsp;

We are very excited about the progress and look forward to the last half of our furlough. &nbsp;We await to see who else wants to team up with us to make Camp Rhino a reality. &nbsp;
