We are close to the end of Phase \#1 of our building stage for Camp Rhino.&nbsp; Our girl housing is almost complete.&nbsp; We hope to finish our first activity center/ auditorium space this month before camp starts on December 10th.&nbsp; The last step of Phase \#1 will be to finish our boys housing space.&nbsp;![](/uploads/img-0408.jpg){: width="2448" height="2433"}&nbsp;
