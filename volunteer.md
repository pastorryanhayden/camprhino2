Do you feel God calling you to the ministry?  Are you preparing to serve Him in Bible college?  Are you looking for a once in a lifetime opportunity to serve God, love people, and experience something completely different you will remember for a lifetime?  **Consider spending a camp season in Port Elizabeth, South Africa working at Camp Rhino.** 

Serving with Camp Rhino you will:


- Help with a new Christian Camp
- Travel to and experience South Africa
- Work alongside veteran missionaries and national pastors
- Meet ministry minded friends from across the world
- Experience church in a different culture

**Most importantly, you’ll have the opportunity to touch the lives of South African children** **and teens** **with the gospel that can not only change their lives, but change their eternities**.    Don’t just sit in a classroom *hearing* *lectures* about missions and world evangelism - *experience* the mission field and *learn about missions with your eyes, your hands and your heart*.  Don’t just spend another summer making money - make memories, make a difference.
