  Who we are and what we are trying to do.

We are a team of missionaries who have voluntarily joined ourselves together to labor together seeing churches planted in South Africa through the training of leaders. There is room for you and much work to do! Will you consider being the next to change your address for the sake of the Gospel?

Camp Rhino is focused on seeing young people saved and mentored in the things of God with the purpose of helping them grow as they minister in their local church.
